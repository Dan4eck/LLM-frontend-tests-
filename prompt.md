Implement a shopping cart feature for a website selling online courses about ai and programming using React with a state management solution. You must:

1. Choose and implement either Redux or MobX (justify your choice based on the specific requirements)
2. Handle multiple interrelated state concerns:
   - Several cart items (add, remove, update quantity)
   - Applied discounts/promotions

3. Ensure optimized rendering (components should only re-render when their specific data changes)
4. Include proper error handling for network requests
5. Make the state persist across page refreshes

your output â€“ 2 files implemeting all the logic. index.js and index.css

Make sure your styling approach is creative
